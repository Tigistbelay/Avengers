Generation

Before I started with Generation I have researched over 300 hours on my own trying to complete a project and that's when I met my first Road Block but I just recently started attending Generation USA Cohort 3 an 11 week program and 
I have researched for over 300 hours of HTML CSS JavaScript GitHub GitBash knowledge also have applied over 400 hours in research to complete assignments of code and styling while attending this beautiful program.  

About Me

I have had 3 Brain Surgeries and 2 Back surgeries so it made me a loving kind hearted person with a strong will to keep progressing in life and focusing on the things that I can change. I am a competitor at heart but also a team player and when I gain knowledge I love sharing and teaching others. I volunteered over 300 hours of my time in my life giving back either to my community or random people that I come across who may need help whether it's a car on the side of the road, trashy area, or anyone that may need a drink or something to eat with or without asking me because I been there before so I put myself in others shoes. My favorite scripture is Walk by faith and not by site!
